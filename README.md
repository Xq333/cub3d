# cub3D Project README

## Overview

The **cub3D** project is an exhilarating journey in my 42 school curriculum. This project challenged me to create a basic 3D game engine from scratch, using raycasting to render a 3D-like environment in a 2D space.

## What I Learned

Through the **cub3D** project, I gained a multitude of knowledge and skills, including:

1. **Raycasting:** I delved into the intricacies of raycasting, a technique that simulates the 3D effect by casting rays from a player's perspective to render the game environment.

2. **3D World Creation:** This project involved crafting a simple 3D world, complete with walls, textures, and interactive objects.

3. **User Interaction:** I learned to create player movement and interaction mechanisms, allowing players to explore the game environment.

4. **Texture Mapping:** I mastered the art of texture mapping, applying textures to walls and objects to give the game world a realistic appearance.

5. **Map Parsing:** I became proficient in reading and parsing map files to generate the game environment dynamically.

6. **Error Handling:** The project taught me effective error handling and how to provide user-friendly error messages for a smoother gaming experience.

## Project Structure

The **cub3D** project typically involves the implementation of raycasting, 3D world creation, user interaction, texture mapping, map parsing, and error handling. It's an enriching experience in graphics programming and game development.

## Usage

The skills I acquired through the **cub3D** project are applicable to game development, graphics programming, and the creation of immersive 3D environments. It equips me with a deeper understanding of raycasting and rendering techniques.
